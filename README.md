# C# Projects

These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework.
# Projects
* [Car Insurance](https://github.com/markedin/CarInsurance)
* [Twenty One Game](https://github.com/markedin/CSharpProjects/tree/main/TwentyOne)


<h3>Car Insurance</h3>
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued, and delete quotes of their choosing.

<h3>Twenty One Game</h3>
This project is a fully functional console based Twenty One game, similar to what you would play at a casino. You are able to enter your name, indicate how much money you have brought, and place bets. All of the logic is handled by the TwentyOneGame.cs class file, which inherits from a more general Game.cs class. There are specific exceptions included that are thrown when the game detects cheating and all exceptions are stored in a logs database with timestamp.
